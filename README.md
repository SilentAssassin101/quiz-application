# quiz-application

## This is a simple quiz application I made to practice Vue 3

I just started learning Vue, so I decided to make a very simple quiz application. 
I already had practice with making components and created and emitting events, so I decided to get more practice with the router. 
I also wanted to challenge myself, so I made this project in just under 90 minutes! 

If I decide to update the project in the future, I should: 
- Visit the + button in the navbar. This button is intended for creating new quizes
- Incorporate some kind of database to store the quiz questions and answers
- Store grades instead of instant-failing users on 1 question failed
- Supply what the correct answer was on failed questions
- Significantly improve UI/UX
